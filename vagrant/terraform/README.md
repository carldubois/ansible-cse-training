# Overview
Sample Vagrant file for installing Ansible and Terraform.

Terraform and Ansible offer a Cloud Infrastructure Automation toolset.

## Background
At the World Wide Technology Advanced Technology Center (ATC) status call on 15 March 2019, there was a presentation and discussion on using HashiCorp Terraform.

This directory contains a Vagrant file to create a work environment to experiment with Terraform. It also installs Ansible and Tower-CLI. You will need to modify the IP address and URL for the version of Terraform. Terraform is delivered as a binary.
